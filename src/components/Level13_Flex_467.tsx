Think ChatGPT + CapCut, but for making winning ads with AI in minutes.</p><p className="text-base sm:text-xl">Icon starts by looking at your video library &amp; tagging scenes (e.g. "sofa," "unboxing"). These scenes become reusable clips used as lego blocks for making ads.</p><p className="text-base sm:text-xl">From there, just enter ideas into AdGPT (ChatGPT for ads) to generate ads with perfectly matching clips for every scene.</p><p className="text-base sm:text-xl">AdGPT gets your ads 80-99% complete. Make edits with AdCut (CapCut for ads) or prompt AdGPT until you're happy.</p><p className="text-base sm:text-xl">3-person creative teams make 30 ads per month. With Icon, they make 300 (&amp; get more winners).</p><p className="text-sm italic">We also replace $2K-$30K in monthly costs: scriptwriting (ChatGPT), video editing (CapCut, Premiere), creative storage (Frame.io, Air, Recharm), UGC (Arcads, MakeUGC, Billo), creative analytics (Motion), competitor ad spying (Foreplay), &amp; more.</p></div>
